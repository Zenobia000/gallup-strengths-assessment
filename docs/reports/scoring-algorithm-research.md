## Executive Summary

This document outlines the scientific foundation for the strength assessment system, refactored to incorporate a state-of-the-art **Hierarchical Multi-dimensional Thurstonian Item Response Theory (H-MIRT) model**. We are moving from a single-layer estimation to a structured psychometric framework that models talents at both the **facet (12) and domain (4) levels**. The assessment will use multi-statement blocks (quartets) generated via a **Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)** approach to ensure fairness. The final output is a **Talent Tier Profile** backed by normative scores, now supplemented with **Domain Balance Metrics (DBI, Entropy, Gini)** to provide a scientifically defensible and holistic talent map.

## 1. Assessment Instrument: Multi-Statement Forced-Choice Model

### 1.1 Rationale for the Upgraded Design

While the v3.0 forced-choice model was a step in the right direction, scholarly research highlights two critical limitations of a simple tallying approach:
1.  **Ipsative Data Limitation**: Simple tallying produces scores that are only meaningful for intra-personal comparison (ranking one's own traits) but are not comparable across individuals.
2.  **Design Imbalance**: A 30-item, 12-facet pairwise design is mathematically impossible to balance perfectly (as per Block Design theory, λ(v-1)=r(k-1) does not yield an integer).

To overcome these, we are adopting an industry-standard and academically validated approach.

### 1.2 Upgraded Instrument Structure

The assessment instrument is evolved from pairs to blocks of statements.

- **Format**: **Forced-Choice Blocks (Quartets)**. Each question presents 4 statements. The user chooses the statement that is **"Most Like Me"** and **"Least Like Me"**.
- **Total Blocks**: To be determined, but a common design is 28-30 blocks.
- **Talent Facets Measured**: 12
- **Scoring Logic**: **Thurstonian Item Response Theory (TIRT)**

This "pick most/least from 4" format provides significantly more psychometric information per item than a simple pairwise choice.

## 2. Detailed Scoring Methodology

### 2.1 Core Scoring Algorithm: Hierarchical Thurstonian IRT (H-MIRT)

We are replacing the previous model with a Hierarchical Thurstonian IRT model. This is the cornerstone of the v5.0 redesign.

**Core Concept:**
The H-MIRT model assumes a two-level structure of talent:
1.  **Facet Level (θ)**: 12 specific talent facets are directly measured from the user's choices using a Thurstonian IRT model.
2.  **Domain Level (η)**: 4 broader talent domains are modeled as higher-order factors that explain the correlations between the 12 talent facets.

The relationship is defined as:
\[ \boldsymbol{\theta}_{facet} = \mathbf{\Lambda}\boldsymbol{\eta}_{domain} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \]
where \( \mathbf{\Lambda} \) is a 12x4 loading matrix defining which facets belong to which domain, and \( \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \) is the facet-specific residual variance.

**Key Advantages:**
- **Solves the Ipsative Problem**: The model's primary output is a set of **normative trait scores** (for both facets and domains) that are comparable across individuals.
- **Structural Validity**: It scientifically validates the "4 Domains x 3 Talents" structure, providing a more robust and theoretically grounded interpretation.
- **Scoring Efficiency**: It allows for more stable estimation of domain scores, even with a limited number of items per facet.

**Scoring Process Overview:**
1.  **Response Collection**: For each block, the user's "most" and "least" choices are recorded.
2.  **Apply Pre-calibrated H-MIRT Model**: The scoring engine applies a pre-calibrated H-MIRT model. This involves complex statistical estimation (e.g., MCMC or EM algorithms) using a library capable of IRT analysis.
3.  **Estimate Latent Traits (θ & η)**: The model simultaneously outputs a vector of 12 facet scores (\(\theta\)) and 4 domain scores (\(\eta\)) for the user.
4.  **Convert to Normative Scores**: The theta and eta scores are then converted into more interpretable normative scores, such as T-scores or Percentiles (0-100).

### 2.2 Block Design: Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)

The design of the statement blocks is critical for the model's accuracy. We will adopt principles from **Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD)** or use **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** to construct the questionnaire.

- **Block Size (k)**: **4** statements per block.
- **Goal**:
    1.  Each of the 12 talent facets appears an equal number of times (r) across all blocks.
    2.  Each possible *pair* of talents is compared a nearly equal number of times (λ).
    3.  Each block is designed to have statements from 3-4 different domains to maximize information and reduce construct overlap.
    4.  Within each block, the four statements should be matched for social desirability.

This scientific approach to test construction minimizes measurement bias and ensures the fairness and validity of the final scores.

## 3. Pre-computation Step: Item Calibration

A TIRT model cannot be applied without first having parameters that describe the psychometric properties of each statement. This requires a one-time, offline **Item Calibration** study.

**Process:**
1.  **Develop Item Pool**: Create a large pool of statements for each of the 12 talent facets.
2.  **Pre-test**: Administer the full set of items to a sufficiently large and representative sample of the target population (n ≈ 300-800).
3.  **Parameter Estimation**: Use the pre-test data to run an IRT analysis and estimate the parameters (e.g., utility, discrimination) for each statement.
4.  **Finalize Instrument**: Select the best-performing statements and arrange them into the final set of approximately balanced blocks for the live assessment.

The output of this phase is a set of item parameters that the live scoring engine will use.

## 4. Talent Tier Interpretation Framework (Refined)

The tiered framework remains central, but it is now applied to both domain and facet scores, and is supplemented with balance metrics.

### 4.1 Tier Classification Logic

1.  **Input**: A vector of 12 normative scores (e.g., percentiles) for the talent facets.
2.  **Process**: The scores are already on a comparable scale. We can now define tiers based on percentile thresholds, which are more meaningful than fixed ranks.
3.  **Output**:
    *   **Dominant**: Talents falling above a certain threshold (e.g., > 75th percentile).
    *   **Supporting**: Talents in the middle range (e.g., 25th to 75th percentile).
    *   **Lesser**: Talents falling below a certain threshold (e.g., < 25th percentile).

**Handling Ties**: Since scores are now continuous latent trait estimates, true ties are rare. Any apparent ties in rounded percentiles can be resolved by referring back to the more precise underlying theta scores.

### 4.2 Report Balance Metrics (New)
To provide users with insight into their overall development profile, we introduce three quantitative balance indicators calculated from the four domain percentile scores (\( \mathbf{p} \)).

1.  **Domain Balance Index (DBI)**: Measures the uniformity of domain scores.
    \[ \mathrm{DBI} = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{Var}(\mathbf{p})}{\mathrm{Var}_{max}} \]
    A score closer to 1 indicates a more balanced profile across the four domains.

2.  **Relative Entropy (H)**: Measures the evenness of the score distribution.
    \[ \pi_i = \frac{p_i}{\sum_j p_j}, \quad H_{rel} = -\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{4}\pi_i\log \pi_i}{\log 4} \]
    A score closer to 1 suggests that the user's strengths are more evenly distributed among the domains.

3.  **Gini Coefficient (G)**: Measures the inequality of the score distribution.
    \[ G = \frac{\sum_{i}\sum_{j}|p_i - p_j|}{2 \cdot 4 \sum_i p_i} \]
    A score closer to 0 indicates a more equal (balanced) distribution. The report may display `1 - Gini` for consistency.

## 5. Quality Assurance & Validation (New)

To ensure the scientific rigor of the assessment, a comprehensive validation strategy will be implemented.

*   **Measurement Equivalence**: We will use multi-group CFA/MIRT to test for measurement invariance (configural, metric, scalar) across key demographic groups (e.g., gender, age) to ensure the test is fair.
*   **Differential Item Functioning (DIF)**: Individual items will be analyzed to ensure they function equivalently for all subgroups, preventing item-level bias.
*   **Reliability**: Reliability will be reported using modern metrics such as marginal reliability from IRT, which is more appropriate than classical alpha.
*   **Validity**:
    *   **Convergent & Discriminant Validity**: Correlate scores with other established psychological measures to ensure our constructs are measuring what they intend to measure and are distinct from other constructs.
    *   **Criterion-related Validity**: Correlate assessment scores with external, objective performance metrics (e.g., job performance ratings, 360-degree feedback) to demonstrate the test's predictive power.

## 6. Implementation Recommendations

The implementation pipeline must be updated to reflect this new, sophisticated model.

1.  **Offline Phase (Pre-requisite)**:
    *   Design and execute the Item Calibration study.
    *   Generate and validate the final IRT item parameter file.
2.  **Online Scoring Pipeline**:
    *   **Input Validation**: Verify complete responses for all blocks.
    *   **Quality Assessment**: Assess response time and patterns. Consider adding person-fit statistics from the IRT model to flag aberrant response patterns.
    *   **Score Estimation**: Load the pre-calibrated IRT parameters and apply the model to the user's responses to estimate the 12 latent trait scores (thetas).
    *   **Score Transformation**: Convert thetas to percentiles.
    *   **Talent Tiering**: Classify the percentiles into Dominant, Supporting, and Lesser tiers based on thresholds.
    *   **Storage**: Save the complete tiered profile, including the normative scores for both facets and domains, and the balance metrics, to the database.
